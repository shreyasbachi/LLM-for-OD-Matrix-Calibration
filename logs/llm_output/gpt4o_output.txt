Here is a realistic hourly distribution of daily vehicle demand, normalized to sum to 1, for a general urban setting:

{
    "5:00 AM": 0.0120,
    "6:00 AM": 0.0350,
    "7:00 AM": 0.0800,
    "8:00 AM": 0.1000,
    "9:00 AM": 0.0750,
    "10:00 AM": 0.0600,
    "11:00 AM": 0.0550,
    "12:00 PM": 0.0500,
    "1:00 PM": 0.0500,
    "2:00 PM": 0.0550,
    "3:00 PM": 0.0600,
    "4:00 PM": 0.0800,
    "5:00 PM": 0.0950,
    "6:00 PM": 0.0800,
    "7:00 PM": 0.0400,
    "8:00 PM": 0.0250,
    "9:00 PM": 0.0150,
    "10:00 PM": 0.0100,
    "11:00 PM": 0.0075,
    "validation_sum": 1.0000
}
Reasoning:
5–6 AM: Low early-morning traffic as city wakes up.

7–9 AM: Morning peak due to commuting, school drop-offs.

10 AM–1 PM: Gradual decline during late morning and early lunch hours.

2–3 PM: Slight increase as school pickups and early commutes begin.

4–6 PM: Evening peak as people return from work, shopping, etc.

7–11 PM: Gradual tapering off, with late-night minimal traffic.

This distribution mirrors real-world patterns in most U.S. metro areas, balancing early risers, typical 9–5 commuters, and evening activities. Let me know if you want versions tailored to specific cities, weekends, or land use types.
