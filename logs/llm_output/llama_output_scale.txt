You are a transportation modeling expert.
I have an origin-destination (OD) matrix representing total daily vehicle demand between zones.
I need to scale these values to estimate the number of vehicles per hour for each time interval between 5:00 AM and 11:00 PM.
Your task is to provide a realistic hourly distribution of traffic (as 19 fractional values that sum to 1) reflecting typical traffic patterns throughout the day. 
Assume a general urban setting with:
- a morning peak around 7–9 AM,
- a midday dip,
- and an evening peak around 4–6 PM.

Output a list of 19 fractional values corresponding to each hour slot, in order from 5:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

**Example Output Structure:**
{
    "5:00 AM": 0.0152,
    "6:00 AM": 0.0428,
   ...,
    "5:00 PM": 0.1214,
    "11:00 PM": 0.0081,
    "validation_sum": 1.0000
}

Also briefly explain the reasoning behind your distribution. 

### Hourly Distribution Explanation
To create a realistic hourly distribution of traffic, we'll follow typical urban traffic patterns. The morning peak (7–9 AM) and evening peak (4–6 PM) will have the highest fractions, while the midday dip (10 AM–3 PM) will have lower fractions. Early morning (5:00 AM–6:00 AM) and late evening (7:00 PM–11:00 PM) will have the lowest fractions.

### Hourly Distribution Calculation
To calculate the hourly distribution, we'll assign fractions to each hour slot based on these patterns.

- Early morning (5:00 AM–6:00 AM): 1.5% each
- Morning peak (7:00 AM–9:00 AM): 10% each
- Late morning (6:00 AM–7:00 AM and 9:00 AM–10:00 AM): 5% each
- Midday dip (10:00 AM–3:00 PM): 3% each
- Evening peak (4:00 PM–6:00 PM): 12% each
- Late evening (7:00 PM–11:00 PM): 2% each

Here is the Python code to generate the distribution:
```python
def generate_hourly_distribution():
    """
    Generate a realistic hourly distribution of traffic in an urban setting.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with hourly time slots as keys and fractional values as values.
    """
    # Define the hourly distribution fractions
    distribution = {
        "5:00 AM": 0.015,
        "6:00 AM": 0.015,
        "7:00 AM": 0.100,
        "8:00 AM": 0.100,
        "9:00 AM": 0.100,
        "10:00 AM": 0.030,
        "11:00 AM": 0.030,
        "12:00 PM": 0.030,
        "1:00 PM": 0.030,
        "2:00 PM": 0.030,
        "3:00 PM": 0.030,
        "4:00 PM": 0.120,
        "5:00 PM": 0.120,
        "6:00 PM": 0.120,
        "7:00 PM": 0.020,
