Below is one example of a realistic hourly distribution from 5:00 AM to 11:00 PM (19 intervals) that sums to 1.0. The values start low in the early morning, rise during the morning commute, dip slightly through late morning and early afternoon, then peak again in the late afternoon rush, and taper off into the evening.

Reasoning Behind the Distribution

Early Morning (5–6 AM): Traffic starts relatively low as only early travelers (e.g., night shift workers or early commuters) are on the road.

Morning Peak (7–9 AM): Commuter travel peaks during these hours as people head to work, schools, and other appointments.

Late Morning / Early Afternoon (10 AM–2 PM): Demand typically drops after the morning rush, though it remains moderately steady due to business errands, midday trips, and lunch-hour movement.

Late Afternoon / Evening Peak (4–6 PM): Demand rises again, often more strongly than the morning peak, as many commuters return home or make after-work trips.

Evening (7–10 PM): Traffic tapers off as the majority of work-related and daytime trips subside. However, some travel for shopping, dining, and social events remains.

Late Evening (10–11 PM): Activity continues to decrease, reflecting fewer trips at night.

These fractional values can be multiplied by any daily OD demand matrix to estimate each hour’s traffic volume in a typical urban environment.
